Welcome to vexora! This quickstart guide will walk you through the basics of using vexora to create AI-powered applications.

You'll learn how to:
1. [Run simple tasks](#running-simple-tasks) with `vexora.run()`
2. [Add context](#adding-context) to improve results
3. [Get structured data](#getting-structured-data) in the format you need
4. [Maintain conversation context](#maintaining-context) with threads

<Warning>

This guide assumes you have already installed `vexora`. See the [installation docs](/installation) for instructions.

</Warning>

## Running Simple Tasks

The fastest way to use vexora is with `vexora.run()`:

```python
import vexora
# Run a simple task
print(vexora.run("Write a haiku about Python programming"))
```

<Accordion title="Output">
```text
Indented lines flow
Functions dance with elegance
Code becomes poetry
```
</Accordion>

## Adding Context

Provide additional context to get better results:

```python
import vexora

data = """
The average temperature in June was 72°F with a high of 85°F and a low of 60°F.
Rainfall totaled 3.5 inches, which is 0.8 inches above normal.
There were 15 sunny days, 10 partly cloudy days, and 5 rainy days.
"""

print(
    vexora.run(
        "Summarize this weather data in one sentence",
        context={"weather_data": data}
    )
)
```

<Accordion title="Output">
```text
The weather in June featured an average temperature of 72°F with 15 sunny days, 10 partly cloudy days, and 5 rainy days, and recorded 3.5 inches of rainfall, which is 0.8 inches above normal.
```
</Accordion>

## Getting Structured Data

Use `result_type` to get data in exactly the format you need:

```python
import vexora
from pydantic import BaseModel

class WeatherDay(BaseModel):
    date: str
    temperature: float
    conditions: str

    def __str__(self):
        return f"{self.date}: {self.temperature}°F, {self.conditions}"

forecast = vexora.run(
    "Create a 3-day weather forecast",
    result_type=list[WeatherDay]
)

print("\n".join(str(day) for day in forecast))
```

<Accordion title="Output">
```text
2024-03-20: 75.5°F, Sunny with light breeze
2024-03-21: 72.0°F, Partly cloudy
2024-03-22: 68.5°F, Light rain showers
```
</Accordion>

## Maintaining Context

Use threads to maintain context across multiple interactions:

```python
import vexora

# Create a thread to maintain conversation context
with vexora.Thread() as thread:

    # Get user preferences
    preferences = vexora.run(
        "Ask about the user's movie preferences",
        cli=True
    )

    # Recommend a movie based on preferences
    recommendation = vexora.run(
        "Recommend a movie based on their preferences",
    )

    # Ask follow-up question using context from the whole conversation
    followup = vexora.run(
        "Ask if they'd like another recommendation in a similar style",
        result_type=bool,
        cli=True
    )

    if followup:
        vexora.run("Provide another movie recommendation")
```

<Accordion title="Output">
```text
Agent: What kinds of movies do you enjoy watching?
User: I like sci-fi movies with deep themes about humanity, like Blade Runner and Ex Machina.

Based on your preference for thought-provoking sci-fi films, I recommend "Arrival" (2016). Like Blade Runner and Ex Machina, it explores deep themes about humanity through a science fiction lens, focusing on language, time, and human connection.

Agent: Would you like another recommendation similar to Arrival and your other favorite sci-fi films?
User: Yes, please!

I recommend "Her" (2013). This thoughtful sci-fi film explores the nature of consciousness, love, and human connection in a near-future world. Like your other favorites, it uses science fiction elements to delve deep into questions about what makes us human and how technology shapes our relationships.

## Common Operations

vexora provides a set of simple functions for common LLM operations. These functions are designed to be intuitive and easy to use, while providing powerful capabilities.

### Classification

Classify text or data into predefined categories:

```python
import vexora

# Using simple labels
sentiment = vexora.classify("I love this product!", ["positive", "negative", "neutral"])
print(sentiment)  # "positive"

# Multi-label classification
topics = vexora.classify(
    "The movie had great acting but poor special effects",
    ["acting", "plot", "effects", "music"],
    multi_label=True
)
print(topics)  # ["acting", "effects"]
```

### Extraction

Extract structured data from text:

```python
import vexora

# Extract numbers
prices = vexora.extract(
    "The shirt costs $19.99 and the pants are $45",
    float,
    instructions="Extract all prices in USD"
)
print(prices)  # [19.99, 45.0]

# Extract custom information
people = vexora.extract(
    "Contact Sarah at sarah@example.com or John at john@example.com",
    str,
    instructions="Extract all email addresses"
)
print(people)  # ["sarah@example.com", "john@example.com"]
```

### Summarization

Create concise summaries of text:

```python
import vexora

text = """
Climate change poses significant challenges to our planet. Rising temperatures 
lead to melting ice caps, rising sea levels, and more extreme weather events. 
Scientists warn that immediate action is necessary to prevent catastrophic effects.
"""

summary = vexora.summarize(text)
print(summary)  # "Climate change threatens Earth with rising temperatures..."

# Focus on specific aspects
summary = vexora.summarize(
    text,
    instructions="Focus on the specific consequences mentioned"
)
print(summary)  # "Key impacts: melting ice caps, rising seas, extreme weather..."
```

### Conversation

Have natural conversations with context:

```python
import vexora

response = vexora.say("What's the capital of France?")
print(response)  # "The capital of France is Paris."

# With specific instructions
response = vexora.say(
    "What's the capital of France?",
    instructions="Respond like a friendly tour guide"
)
print(response)  # "Ah, Bonjour! Let me tell you about Paris..."
```

Each of these functions is designed to be simple to use while providing powerful capabilities. They all support:

- Custom instructions to guide the model's behavior
- Thread management for maintaining context
- Custom agents for specialized tasks
- Additional context for better results
