---

The `plan` function helps you break down complex objectives into a series of smaller, manageable tasks. 
It's particularly useful for handling large or complex goals that benefit from being tackled incrementally.

For simple tasks, you can use `vexora.run()` directly. The `plan` function is designed for complex 
workflows that benefit from being broken down into steps - see [Task Planning](/concepts/tasks#task-planning) 
for more details.

## Usage

Create a simple task plan:

```python
import vexora

# Create and execute a series of tasks
tasks = vexora.plan("Create a new blog post about AI trends")
vexora.run_tasks(tasks)
```

## Parameters

- `instructions`: The objective to achieve
- `agent`: Optional agent to use for planning
- `thread`: Optional thread for conversation context
- `context`: Optional dict of additional context
- `available_agents`: Optional list of agents that can be used for planning
- `tools`: Optional list of tools that can be used for planning
- `parent_task`: Optional parent task for the planned tasks

## Returns

Returns a list of `Task` objects that, when completed, will achieve the specified objective.

## Async Support

The function is also available in an async version:

```python
import vexora
import asyncio

async def main():
    tasks = await vexora.plan_async(
        "Create a new blog post about AI trends"
    )
    await vexora.run_tasks_async(tasks)

asyncio.run(main())
```

## Examples

### Multiple Agents

Assign different tasks to specialized agents:

```python
import vexora

# Create specialized agents
researcher = vexora.Agent(name="Researcher", model="openai:gpt-4")
writer = vexora.Agent(name="Writer", model="openai:gpt-4")
editor = vexora.Agent(name="Editor", model="openai:gpt-4")

# Plan tasks with multiple agents
tasks = vexora.plan(
    "Create a comprehensive research report on quantum computing",
    available_agents=[researcher, writer, editor]
)
vexora.run_tasks(tasks)
```

### With Context

Provide additional requirements:

```python
import vexora

# Provide detailed context for planning
context = {
    "target_audience": "technical professionals",
    "word_count": 2000,
    "key_topics": ["neural networks", "transformers", "reinforcement learning"]
}

tasks = vexora.plan(
    "Write a technical blog post about AI advancements",
    context=context
)
vexora.run_tasks(tasks)
```

### With Tools

Make specific tools available to tasks:

```python
import vexora

def fetch_papers(topic: str, limit: int = 5) -> list[str]:
    """Fetch latest research papers on a topic."""
    pass

def analyze_sentiment(text: str) -> float:
    """Analyze sentiment of text."""
    pass

tasks = vexora.plan(
    "Create a sentiment analysis report for recent AI papers",
    tools=[fetch_papers, analyze_sentiment]
)
vexora.run_tasks(tasks)
```
