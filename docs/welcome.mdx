## What is vexora?

**vexora is a Python framework for building AI applications with LLMs.**




vexora provides a clean, intuitive interface for working with large language models (LLMs) while handling all the complexity of state management, conversation history, and agent coordination.

## Quick Examples

<Tip>  
Using `uv`? Run the examples below by copying them to your clipboard and executing:  

<CodeGroup>  
```bash macOS  
pbpaste | uv run --with vexora -  
```  
```bash Linux
xclip -selection clipboard -o | uv run --with vexora -  
```  
```bash windows
Get-Clipboard | uv run --with vexora -
```

</CodeGroup>  

</Tip>  

### Simple Tasks

The fastest way to use vexora is with `vexora.run()`:

<CodeGroup>

```python  Run a simple task
import vexora

print(vexora.run("Write a haiku about artificial intelligence"))
```

```python Provide context for more accurate results
import httpx
import vexora

print(
    vexora.run(
        "Summarize the current astronauts in space like a 50s news anchor",
        context={"data": httpx.get("http://api.open-notify.org/astros.json", headers={"Accept": "application/json"}).json()}
    )
)
```

</CodeGroup>
### Specialized Agents

Create agents with specific skills and personalities:

```python
import vexora

# Create specialized agents
poet = vexora.Agent(
    name="Poet",
    instructions="You are an expert poet who writes in various styles."
)

scientist = vexora.Agent(
    name="Scientist",
    instructions="You are a scientist who explains complex topics clearly."
)

# Use them for specific tasks
explanation = vexora.run(
    "Explain entropy briefly",
    agents=[scientist]
)

poem = vexora.run(
    "Write a haiku about entropy",
    agents=[poet],
    context={"scientific_explanation": explanation}
)
```

### Structured Data

Get results in exactly the format you need:

```python
from typing import Annotated, Literal
import vexora
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field

class Character(BaseModel):
    name: str
    role: Literal["hero", "villain", "sidekick"]
    aura: Annotated[float, Field(ge=0, le=1)]

# Get structured results
characters = vexora.run(
    "Create three characters for a mystery story",
    result_type=list[Character]
)

for char in characters:
    print(f"{char.name} - {char.role} - {char.aura}")
```

### Persistent Memory

Give your agents memory that persists across conversations:

```python
import vexora

# Create a memory module
preferences = vexora.Memory(
    key="user_preferences",
    instructions="Remember user preferences and style"
)

# Create an agent with memory
assistant = vexora.Agent(memories=[preferences])

# The agent will remember information across conversations
vexora.run(
    "Learn about the user's writing style preferences",
    agents=[assistant],
    cli=True
)
```

## Why vexora?
