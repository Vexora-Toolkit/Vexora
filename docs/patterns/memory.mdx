While threads maintain conversation history within a single interaction, vexora's memory feature allows agents to store and recall information across multiple conversations. This is useful for:

- Remembering user preferences across sessions
- Building up knowledge bases over time
- Sharing information between different agents
- Maintaining context across multiple interactions
- Creating more personalized user experiences

## How Memory Works

vexora memories are implemented as vector stores that allow agents to store and retrieve information using natural language. Each memory has a unique `key` that identifies it and instructions that guide how it should be used.

## Creating Memory Modules

To create a memory module, you need to provide a `key` and `instructions`:

```python
import vexora

# Create a memory for user preferences
preferences = vexora.Memory(
    key="user_preferences",
    instructions="Store and retrieve user preferences and settings."
)
```

### Memory Keys

The `key` uniquely identifies a memory module and must be consistent across uses to access the same stored information. Choose descriptive, unique keys for different types of information:

```python
# Different memories for different purposes
user_prefs = vexora.Memory(key="user_preferences")
knowledge_base = vexora.Memory(key="documentation")
project_info = vexora.Memory(key="project_details")
```

### Memory Instructions

The `instructions` tell agents how to use the memory - what to store, when to access it, and how to format information:

```python
weather_memory = vexora.Memory(
    key="weather",
    instructions="""
    Store daily weather information including:
    - Temperature
    - Conditions
    - Location
    Format: 'Location: temp, conditions'
    """
)
```

## Using Memories

### With Tasks

Attach memories to tasks to provide context:

```python
import vexora

# Create a memory module
weather = vexora.Memory(key="weather")

# Use it in a task
task = vexora.Task(
    instructions="What was yesterday's weather?",
    memories=[weather]
)
```

### With Agents

Give agents persistent memory across all their tasks:

```python
import vexora

# Create an agent with memory
agent = vexora.Agent(
    name="WeatherBot",
    memories=[weather]
)

# The agent can access weather memory in any task
vexora.run("Record today's weather", agents=[agent])
vexora.run("Compare to yesterday's weather", agents=[agent])
```

## Example: Weather Tracking

Here's a complete example of using memory to track weather information:

```python
import vexora

# Create a memory module
weather = vexora.Memory(
    key="weather",
    instructions="Store and retrieve daily weather information."
)

# Record today's weather
vexora.run(
    "Record that it's 72°F and sunny today",
    memories=[weather]
)

# Later, retrieve the information
result = vexora.run(
    "What was the weather like today?",
    memories=[weather]
)
print(result)
```

```text
Today's weather was 72°F and sunny.
```

## Memory Providers

vexora supports several vector store backends for memory storage:

### ChromaDB (Default)

ChromaDB is the default provider, offering a simple, file-based vector store:

<CodeGroup>
```bash pip
pip install "vexora[chroma]"
```

```bash uv
uv pip install "vexora[chroma]"
```
</CodeGroup>

### LanceDB

LanceDB provides a fast, efficient vector store with columnar storage:

<CodeGroup>

```bash pip
pip install "vexora[lance]"
```

```bash uv
uv pip install "vexora[lance]"
```

</CodeGroup>

Configure LanceDB:
```python
import vexora
from vexora.memory.providers import LanceProvider

provider = LanceProvider(uri="data/memories.lance")
memory = vexora.Memory(
    key="knowledge",
    provider=provider
)
```

### PostgreSQL

Use PostgreSQL with pgvector for scalable, production-ready vector storage:

<CodeGroup>

```bash pip
pip install "vexora[postgres]"
```

```bash uv
uv pip install "vexora[postgres]"
```

</CodeGroup>
Configure PostgreSQL:
```python
import vexora
from vexora.memory.providers import PostgresProvider

provider = PostgresProvider(
    connection_string="postgresql://user:pass@localhost/db"
)
memory = vexora.Memory(
    key="knowledge",
    provider=provider
)
```

### All Providers

Install all memory providers at once:

<CodeGroup>
```bash pip
pip install "vexora[memory]"  # Includes chroma, lance, and postgres
```

```bash uv
uv pip install "vexora[memory]"  # Includes chroma, lance, and postgres
```
</CodeGroup>
