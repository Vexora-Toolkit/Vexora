Tasks represent discrete units of work that need to be completed by AI agents. vexora provides several ways to execute tasks and retrieve their results.

## Creating and Running Tasks

The most convenient way to run a task is with the `vexora.run()` function. This function creates and runs a task in a single call, accepting all the same arguments as the `Task` constructor:

<CodeGroup>
```python Code
import vexora

poem = vexora.run("Write a poem about AI")
print(poem)
```

```text Result
In circuits deep and code profound,
An AI's mind begins to sound.
Electric thoughts and data streams,
Crafting worlds and shaping dreams.
```
</CodeGroup>

### Running a Single Task

You can also create a task first and run it later using the `run()` method:

<CodeGroup>
```python Code
import vexora

task = vexora.Task("Write a poem about AI")
poem = task.run()

print(poem)
```

```text Result
In circuits deep and code profound,
An AI's mind begins to sound.
Electric thoughts and data streams,
Crafting worlds and shaping dreams.
```
</CodeGroup>

### Running Multiple Tasks

To run multiple tasks at once, use the `run_tasks()` function:

```python
import vexora

task_1 = vexora.Task("Write a poem about AI")
task_2 = vexora.Task("Critique the poem", depends_on=[task_1])

results = vexora.run_tasks([task_1, task_2])
# Can also access task_1.result and task_2.result
```

## Task Dependencies

Tasks can depend on other tasks, ensuring they run in the correct order:

```python
import vexora

name_task = vexora.Task("Get the user's name", cli=True)
poem_task = vexora.Task(
    "Write a poem about the user",
    depends_on=[name_task]
)

# Running poem_task will automatically run name_task first
poem = poem_task.run()
```

When you run a task, vexora will:
1. Check if there are any dependencies
2. Run any incomplete dependencies first
3. Execute the task itself
4. Return the result

## Task Results

Tasks can specify their expected result type using the `result_type` parameter:

```python
import vexora

# Get a boolean result
is_spam = vexora.run(
    "Is this email spam?",
    result_type=bool,
    context={"email": "You just won a million dollars!"}
)

# Get a list of integers
rolls = vexora.run(
    "Roll 3 dice",
    result_type=list[int],
    tools=[roll_dice]
)
```

## Task Status

You can check a task's status at any time:

```python
import vexora

task = vexora.Task("Write a poem")

# Before running
print(task.status)  # TaskStatus.PENDING

# After running
task.run()
print(task.status)  # TaskStatus.SUCCESSFUL
```

Tasks have several helper methods for checking their status:
- `is_pending()`: Task hasn't started
- `is_running()`: Task is currently executing
- `is_successful()`: Task completed successfully
- `is_failed()`: Task failed to complete
- `is_skipped()`: Task was skipped
- `is_complete()`: Task is done (successful, failed, or skipped)
- `is_incomplete()`: Task isn't done (pending or running)
- `is_ready()`: Task can be run (dependencies are complete)

## Task Context

Tasks maintain their own context, which can include:
- Instructions: What needs to be done
- Context: Additional information needed for the task
- Tools: Functions the agent can use
- Memories: Persistent information from previous runs
- Result type: Expected format of the output

This context helps agents understand and complete the task effectively:

```python
import vexora

task = vexora.Task(
    instructions="Analyze the sentiment of this text",
    context={"text": "I love this product!"},
    result_type=str,
    memories=[knowledge_base],
    tools=[analyze_text]
)
```
